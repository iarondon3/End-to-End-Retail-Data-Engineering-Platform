# 🍃 Unit 3: NoSQL Integration (MongoDB)

## 📌 Overview
While the relational model (PostgreSQL) excelled at transactional integrity, it was too rigid for capturing diverse customer behaviors and rapidly changing data schemas. In this module, we integrated **MongoDB** to handle semi-structured data and perform flexible analytics.

**Objective:** Design a document-oriented model to enable fast retrieval of complete customer transaction history and perform aggregations that would be costly in SQL.

## 🛠️ Key Techniques Applied
* **SQL to NoSQL Migration:** Migrated relational data into JSON document collections.
* **Document Modeling:** Applied the **Embedding Strategy** (denormalization) for the `Sales` collection to optimize read performance (avoiding JOINs).
* **Aggregation Framework:** Used complex pipelines (`$match`, `$group`, `$unwind`) to calculate business metrics like "Average Basket Size".
* **Sharding:** Designed a sharding strategy based on Geography (`country`) to ensure horizontal scalability.
